1.1 Introduction                                                                
    ------------                                                                
    MINE is a powerful Rexx utility developed to build a structure              
    chart of a COBOL source. Just press <PF1> under any paragraph.              
    A visual diagram that shows all the calling paragraphs and                  
    called paragraphs is displayed on the screen.                               
                                                                                
    Pressing <PF2> on any PERFORM <para> statement, allows you to               
    jump directly to the called paragraph. Press <PF4> within the               
    called paragraph, takes you back to the last PERFORM statement.             
    You can traverse upto any number of levels.                                 
                                                                                
1.2 How to use

    You may invoked MINE on the ISPF Editor.

    ======                                                                      
    MINE {parameter}                                                            
                                                                                
    The parameter passed to the MINE EXEC determines the function               
    to be performed. The parameter could be one of these values                 
    IN, OUT or GRAPH.

    Copy the MINE EXEC in this PDS to any library under your                    
    //SYSPROC or //SYSEXEC concatenations. It is recommended to change          
    your ISPF Editor Keylist settings as follows; assign the command            
    MINE IN to <PF2>, MINE OUT to <PF4> and MINE GRAPH <PF1>.
