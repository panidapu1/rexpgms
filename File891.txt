//***FILE 891 is from Quasar Chunawala and contains a REXX program  *   FILE 891
//*           to flow-chart a COBOL program automatically, given    *   FILE 891
//*           its source code.  This program is called MINE.        *   FILE 891

//*     MINE is a powerful REXX utility developed to build the      *   FILE 891
//*     structure chart of a COBOL source. Just press <PF1>         *   FILE 891
//*     under any paragraph. A visual diagram that shows all        *   FILE 891
//*     calling paragraphs and called paragraphs is displayed on    *   FILE 891
//*     the screen.                                                 *   FILE 891
//*                                                                 *   FILE 891
//*     Pressing <PF2> on any PERFORM <para> statement, allows      *   FILE 891
//*     you to jump directly to the called paragraph. Press         *   FILE 891
//*     <PF4> within the called paragraph, takes you back the       *   FILE 891
//*     last PERFORM statement. You can traverse upto any number    *   FILE 891
//*     levels and back up.                                         *   FILE 891
//*                                                                 *   FILE 891
//*     This script implements several data-structures in Rexx.     *   FILE 891
//*     MINE was written keeping in mind, a structured top-down     *   FILE 891
//*     programming methodology. It is therefore, divided into      *   FILE 891
//*     several smaller routines. MINE also uses two panels         *   FILE 891
//*     DYNPANE and MINEMESG, which it generates.                   *   FILE 891
//*                                                                 *   FILE 891
//*     You may invoke MINE on the ISPF Editor. The syntax is       *   FILE 891
//*     MINE <function>, where <function> parameter could be IN,    *   FILE 891
//*     OUT or GRAPH.  I have set my PFKeys as <PF1> - MINE         *   FILE 891
//*     GRAPH, <PF2> - MINE IN and <PF4> - MINE OUT.                *   FILE 891
//*                                                                 *   FILE 891
